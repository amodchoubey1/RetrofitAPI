Retrofit API


Retrofit is a rest client for java and android.

 Retrofit library developed by Square to handle REST API calls in our android application.

 It is used for network transaction.

 It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON through REST webservice .

 Retrofit automatically serialises the JSON response using a POJO(Plain Old Java Object).

 Retrofit is a type safe http client which has a very high benchmark scores on comparison with other network libraries .

 We need three things when work with Retrofit .

Model class which is used to map the JSON data (response parse from sever).
Interfaces which defines the possible HTTP operations (defines different operatrions).
Builder class - defining the URL end point for the HTTP operation.
 No need to take care about parsing of JSON response.  It is developed by Square. 
